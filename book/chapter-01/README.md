# In brief

This cookbook is targeting developers who already have a basic understanding of what React is and how it works. It's not meant to be used as a comprehensive how-to guide but rather as an introduction to popular concepts and design patternsâ€”paradigms that are more or less introduced by the community. It encourages abstract thinking. For example, instead of discussing Redux, it focuses on data flow, and instead of diving into higher-order components, it emphasizes composition.

The book takes a highly opinionated stance. It reflects my own understanding of the described patterns, and it's possible that there are differing interpretations out there on the web. Please keep this in mind when engaging in discussions or using this book as a reference in arguments.
